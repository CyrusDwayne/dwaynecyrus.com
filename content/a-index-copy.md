hey. hi. hello.

Welcome my friend
I'm Cyrus, a (brand strategist) designer of brand strategy, pretty things, and content for good/indelible men. (Things links go to landing pages)

I'm Cyrus a designer of strategy, pretty things, and content.

Content here is focused on designing live that are creatively fulfilling, productive and meaningful, and emotionally intelligent/healthy.

This is my home on the interwebs where I live, work, and play. You will find many things about me here, with an ever growing number of goodies just for you. Consider this a place for being chill, learning & sharing, and making mistakes.

Think digital garden — seeds of creativity, productivity, and strategy with a few extras on the side.

Think living documentary — the ups and downs of life, winning and losing, all recorded as an example for how to live life.

    <h3>Familia Newsletter</h3>
    <p>Think of it like a digital penpal from me to you.To start, I’m beginning with a weekly newsletter, a digest of everything I’m learning with practical tips and
      lessons that you can implement in you own life.
    </p>
    <p>A weekly digest of everything I'm learning from my wins and losses each week, as I grow my reputation (the brand), develop as an artist and designer, and build my business from the ground up.</p>
    <p>If you are down for hard truths and putting in the work, join the tribe and let's design our
      lives together!</p>
      <!-- IDEA CONSIDER Adding <p>
        The best way to keep up with my progress is through my weekly [Wholesome Letters](/letters). It's where I will share the small beauties that I experience in my life like a pen pal. I will also include any useful links for my fellow neurodivergents, survivors, and creatives.
      </p> -->

    <!-- { { partial "forms/subscribe-home.html" . }} -->

    <!-- <p class="subscribe-note"><small><strong>Note:</strong> Note: I will never sell, trade, spam or do anything dishonorable with your information. There’s also an <a href="/newsletter">archive of past newsletters</a> if you want to get a better sense of what to expect from week to week.</small></p> -->

Consider using some of the content below:

```
  <section>
    <p>Welcome to the construction zone that is my home on the interweb. I am a skilled logo & graphic designer, visual artist across mediums, and content creator (YouTube life).</p>

    <p>My website acts as a living testament and representation of me reclaiming my voice. As a neurodivergent person of color and childhood/adult male survivor, I have unique perspective on life that I believe can help others. I will be documenting my journey in accepting my neurodivergent identity, healing sexual abuse & trauma, and my development as an independent artist & designer. While documenting I will curate and share my learnings here for others like myself.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>I am available for hire as a designer and commissions as an artist, you can find available originals and prints at my humble [Shop](/shop). If any of my personal art interests you for purchase or to be made into a print, please let me know.</p>
    
    <p>Oh, and by request of my family (shout-out the Cheer Squad) I have made available a few ways in which you can show me some love on the [Support Page](/support). By the way I think snail mail is awesome, so feel free to write me.</p>
    
    <p>Last, but not least the website will be updated weekly with new content (notes, poems, art, etc.) so be sure to come back and visit me again. Or signup for my Wholesome Letters to get the warmest of the latest and greatest from me.</p>
